# 🛡️ Ethical Hacking Honours Class - Day 1 Notes

## 📅 Session Summary - Day 1

Today marked the beginning of our Ethical Hacking Honours course. The session was introductory but packed with valuable insights into foundational cybersecurity concepts. Here's a summary of what I learned:

---

## 🔍 What is Hacking?

* **Hacking** refers to gaining unauthorized access to systems or devices.
* It can be ethical (authorized) or malicious (unauthorized).
* Ethical hackers use their skills to strengthen system defenses.

---

## 🧠 Types of Cyber Attacks Covered:

1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack**:

   * An attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties.
   * Common in public Wi-Fi environments.
   * Tools can spoof identities and hijack sessions.

2. **Zero-Day Attack**:

   * Targets unknown vulnerabilities.
   * No existing patches or defenses.
   * Highly dangerous and often exploited quickly after discovery.

3. **Other Common Attack Types** (briefly discussed):

   * **Phishing**
   * **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**
   * **Ransomware**
   * **SQL Injection**

## 🧑‍💻 Classifications of Ethical Hackers

* **Red Team**:

  * Offensive security experts.
  * Simulate real-world attacks.
  * Goal: find vulnerabilities before real attackers do.

* **Blue Team**:

  * Defensive security professionals.
  * Monitor, detect, and respond to threats.
  * Goal: protect the organization's assets and infrastructure.

* **Purple Team**:

  * A collaborative blend of Red and Blue Teams.
  * Encourages knowledge sharing.
  * Improves overall security posture by combining attack and defense strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools/Platforms Introduced

Our mentor introduced a **tool/platform** that can be configured to simulate hacking or gain access to devices (ethically). While the exact name will be noted in the next session, the tool appears to support device/network scanning, attack simulations, and configuration for penetration testing.

## 💭 Takeaway

This session was an exciting start to the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Looking forward to learning more about real-world tools, frameworks, and responsible security practices in the upcoming classes.
